            Hey👋there, I’m Satish Sahu — a curious soul from Prayagraj, India , who believes life is best lived when curiosity meets courage. I’m an AI Engineer, passionate traveller, and storyteller at heart. From the historic ghats of Prayagraj to the neon skylines of Tokyo🗼, my journey has been about unfolding not just passports, but perspectives. I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (Class of 2025) — a place that taught me how to build machines that think, and dreams that fly. Today, I live and work in Tokyo, Japan, blending technology with creativity — building the future with AI by day, and exploring the world’s stories by night🌏. <br></br><br></br>Through my YouTube channel and blog, I share slices of my adventures — the laughter on mountain trails, the calm of ocean waves, the spark of local festivals, the taste of street food, and the insights gathered from people and places that shape me.  <br></br><br></br>My goal is simple: to inspire others to explore — the world outside and the world within. When I’m not coding or creating, you’ll probably find me lifting weights at the gym, hiking under open skies, writing blogs that make life a little easier, or chasing sunsets across city skylines with friends and a camera. Because to me, every journey — whether through a new country or a new line of code — is a story waiting to be lived and shared.<br></br><br></br></p>
